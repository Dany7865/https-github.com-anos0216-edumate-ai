🚀 Abstract
EduMate.AI is a powerful, web-based platform that simplifies college academics and empowers students with intelligent career guidance. It combines two key components:

Smart Academic Assistant: A voice/chat-based assistant that uses LLMs (like GPT/Gemini) to assess student interests and skills and generate personalized career roadmaps with curated learning resources.

Student Portal: A unified platform offering semester-wise notes, PYQs (Previous Year Questions), curated video lectures, important questions, and productivity tools like resume builders and PDF utilities.

💡 Problem Statement
First-year college students often lack centralized, reliable, and accessible academic content. Additionally, they struggle with making informed career decisions due to the absence of personalized guidance. Existing platforms are either fragmented or lack the intelligence to adapt to individual student needs.
